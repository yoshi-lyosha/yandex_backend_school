# What is that?
this is simple API for task from https://github.com/backendschool

it's description you can find [here](./TASK.pdf)

## How did i solved that?
with difficulties... but this is the point why i want to join backend school 

API is written by [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and i enjoyed that a lot, really (just look on the autogenerated [docs](http://84.201.157.195:8080/docs) and validation)

### Requirements

Python3.6+


### How to start
locally
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

but before you will ned some preparations as
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements

```

on server (will spawn 1 worker per core)
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```


### Run test

PYTHONPATH=${PWD} SERVER_HOST=localhost SERVER_PORT=8000 pytest -v --tb=short app/tests/
```

```

##### why did i choose sqlite?

just because that was easier to start with and last 2 hours before the actual deploy i've tried hard to change all on postgres but failed :c  
that's very sad, but i thing that it's pretty possible without any code changes


###### So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish
